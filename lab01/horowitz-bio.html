   <body>
    I am an innovation, society and technology major, I like using technology to help people.
    I got many “M” awards in high school. I also was student ambassador for my high school and two different charities. 
    I recently have been really into crocheting, and watching “Psych”. I have one sister and a dog who my family all loves the most.
